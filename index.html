        <h3>What is ESAPI?</h3>

<p>ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API - catchy, eh?) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.</p>

<p>Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the same basic design:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a set of security control interfaces. They define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.</li>
<li>There is a reference implementation for each security control. The logic is not organization‐specific and the logic is not application‐specific. An example: string‐based input validation.</li>
<li>There are optionally your own implementations for each security control. There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication.</li>
</ul><p>The following organizations are a few of the many organizations that are starting to adopt ESAPI to secure their web applications: American Express, Apache Foundation, Booz Allen Hamilton, Aspect Security, Coraid, The Hartford, Infinite Campus, Lockheed Martin, MITRE, U.S. Navy - SPAWAR, The World Bank, SANS Institute.</p>

<h3>Is this the official repository?</h3>

<p>Not currently. For the official repository go <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-php/">here</a>. The move to github is an experiment to see if it will raise community awareness and involvement in the ESAPI project and other OWASP initiatives.</p>

<h3>Where can I find more information?</h3>

<p>The official <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API">OWASP ESAPI</a> website provides a wealth of information about all of the ESAPI language variants.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP website</a> is an invaluable resource on security mitigation techniques and other great security related projects.</p>
