{"body":"### What is ESAPI?\r\nESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API - catchy, eh?) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.\r\n\r\nAllowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the same basic design:\r\n\r\n* There is a set of security control interfaces. They define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.\r\n* There is a reference implementation for each security control. The logic is not organization‐specific and the logic is not application‐specific. An example: string‐based input validation.\r\n* There are optionally your own implementations for each security control. There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication.\r\n\r\nThe following organizations are a few of the many organizations that are starting to adopt ESAPI to secure their web applications: American Express, Apache Foundation, Booz Allen Hamilton, Aspect Security, Coraid, The Hartford, Infinite Campus, Lockheed Martin, MITRE, U.S. Navy - SPAWAR, The World Bank, SANS Institute.\r\n\r\n###Is this the official repository?\r\nNot currently. For the official repository go [here](http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-php/). The move to github is an experiment to see if it will raise community awareness and involvement in the ESAPI project and other OWASP initiatives.\r\n\r\n###Where can I find more information?\r\nThe official [OWASP ESAPI](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) website provides a wealth of information about all of the ESAPI language variants.\r\n\r\nThe [OWASP website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) is an invaluable resource on security mitigation techniques and other great security related projects.\r\n\r\n### License Information\r\nThe source code is licensed under the BSD license, which is very permissive and about as close to public domain as is possible.
